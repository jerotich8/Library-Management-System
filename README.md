- Manage borrowers (add, update, delete, and view).
- Record book check-outs and returns.
- Track overdue books.
- search for books by title

## Disclaimer

The project is still a work in progress. It serves as my way of practicing what i have learnt from software engineering course.
Iam still learning how to intergrate the user interface and the back-end. 

Any contributions is welcome.
